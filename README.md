I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Use stacks to arrange views
- Use Colors and frames
- Use Gradients
- Use Buttons and images
- Show alert messages
- Style images using SwiftUI modifiers

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
